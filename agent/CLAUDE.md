# CLAUDE.md

Working brief for **order-triage-agent** — the Strands agent, its local tools, and the
AgentCore Runtime entrypoint. See `README.md` for full architecture diagrams and the
5-repo split; this file is the orientation an agent needs to work in the code.

## Commands

```bash
make setup     # uv venv + dev deps        (uv sync --extra dev)
make skills    # copy skills + ontology bindings + kb/ from ../knowledge
make test      # hermetic unit tests — no network, no model   (uv run pytest tests -q)
make lint      # ruff                       (uv run ruff check .)
```

- Run one test: `uv run pytest tests/test_stream_steps.py -k test_name -q`.
- Python is pinned to 3.12; everything runs through `uv run`.
- **There is no local run target.** The runtime is Gateway-only and hard-errors without a
  user JWT + `GATEWAY_URL`. Exercise the full path through the deployed runtime (e.g. the
  order-triage-webapp OBO client), not locally.

## Layout

- `src/order_triage/`
  - `agent.py` — `build_agent()`: assembles the system prompt, tool surface, `BedrockModel`
    (built inline), and memory. The single constructor used by the runtime.
  - `runtime.py` — AgentCore entrypoint (`BedrockAgentCoreApp`, `/invocations` + `/ping`):
    forwards the inbound user JWT, opens the Gateway MCP session for the turn, streams
    output. Needs the `deploy` extra; not imported by the tests.
  - `gateway.py` — Gateway MCP client; sends the user JWT as the bearer.
  - `identity.py` — per-request user identity (a `ContextVar`): the inbound OBO bearer and
    its subject (the memory `actor_id`).
  - `memory.py` — AgentCore Memory session manager (short + long term).
  - `skill_loader.py`, `tools/ontology.py` — read the fetched `skills/` + `bindings.json`.
  - `tools/` — the **local** tools (`search_policies`, `describe_entity`, `load_skill`).
  - `stream_steps.py` — pure classifier turning Strands events into typed `__step__`
    timeline events (unit-tested off the runtime).
  - `config.py` — env-driven `Config.from_env()`, `lru_cache`d via `get_config()`.
- `tests/` — hermetic unit tests (local tools, loaders, identity, stream classifier).
- `skills/`, `ontology/`, `kb/` — fetched content, gitignored (see below).
- `scripts/fetch_skills.sh`, `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `../.github/workflows/` (agent-ci.yml, agent-build.yml).

## How it works (orientation)

- **Gateway-only.** The backend tools — `snowflake___ask`, `sap___getCreditStatus`, `orders___flagOrder` — are **not in this repo**.
  The AgentCore Gateway serves them as MCP tools (Cedar-authorized, brokered
  on-behalf-of the user via `grant_type=TOKEN_EXCHANGE`) and they are passed into the agent
  as `extra_tools` at runtime. The agent forwards the inbound user JWT and mints no
  credentials itself.
- **Local tools** (`search_policies` → Bedrock Knowledge Base; `describe_entity` → ontology
  bindings; `load_skill`) never traverse the Gateway and are always present.
- **Skills / ontology / KB are fetched content, not code.** `make skills` copies them from the
  in-tree `../knowledge` folder into `skills/`, `ontology/`, `kb/` (all gitignored) — no GitHub
  fetch, no token. The agent degrades gracefully to an empty catalog when they're absent.

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Prefer built-ins and the existing stack over custom code.** Reach first for the standard
  library, deps already in `pyproject.toml`, and AWS-native primitives (Bedrock / AgentCore,
  Strands) — hand-roll a helper or add a dependency only when nothing existing fits.
- **Comments and docstrings state the what / why / how of the code's _current_ state** — never
  how it got there. Keep provenance, change history, dated proof points, and PR/phase references
  out of inline comments and docstrings.
- **The "how it got here" lives in ADRs, not code.** This component owns none; cross-cutting design
  decisions are recorded in the owning component's `docs/adr/` (`../infra/docs/adr/`,
  `../knowledge/docs/adr/`). Keep those current and consistent across the mono-repo when a
  decision changes.
- **After generating or editing a mermaid diagram, run the `mermaid-check` skill** and fix
  whatever it flags (parse errors, overlapping nodes/edges) before committing. The README's
  architecture diagram is mermaid.
- **`identity.py` decodes the JWT payload without verifying the signature** — the CUSTOM_JWT
  authorizer already verified it upstream, and the subject is used only as a memory
  partition key, never to authorize. Never log token bytes or claim values.
- **`requestMetadata` values must stay opaque, charset-limited, and PII-free** (`agent.py`
  strips them); never put an email/UPN/raw subject into a Converse call.
- **Ontology names ≠ Snowflake fields.** The ontology (`SalesOrder.soNumber`, …) is a
  routing/governance map; the backend tools return runtime fields
  (`order_id` / `amount` / `status`). Ontology names are for routing, never tool arguments.
- **Tests must stay hermetic** — no network, no model, no AWS. Backend tools are exercised
  only on the deployed runtime.
- **ruff**: line-length 100, `select = E, F, I, UP, B`, `E501` ignored. Run `make lint`
  before committing.
- **Record recurring tool/command failures and their fixes here** as you hit them (a flaky
  `make` target, an AWS call needing a specific flag, a deploy step with a non-obvious order) so
  the same dead end isn't rediscovered.
- **Keep this file lean.** Update lines when findings change — correct a stale line rather than
  appending a new one; context budget is finite.

## Git / PRs

- Branch off `main` (don't commit to it directly). Squash-merge PRs; commit subjects follow
  conventional style (`feat(agent):`, `docs:`, `chore:`) and land on `main` as `… (#NN)`.
- **Work in your own git worktree** so parallel agents don't collide on the shared checkout.
  Default location (a shared root outside the repo): `git worktree add
  ../.worktrees/bedrock-demo/<branch> -b <branch>`. After pushing the branch, remove it:
  `git worktree remove ../.worktrees/bedrock-demo/<branch>` (then `git worktree prune`).
- CI (`../.github/workflows/agent-ci.yml`) runs ruff + the hermetic tests on every PR.
